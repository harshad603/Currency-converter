Project Title: Python GUI Currency Converter

Description:
This Python project aims to develop a Graphical User Interface (GUI) application for currency conversion using Python's Tkinter library. The application will allow users to convert currencies easily by entering the amount in one currency and selecting the desired conversion currency from a dropdown menu.

Features:

User-friendly interface with clear input fields and dropdown menus for currency selection.
Real-time currency conversion rates fetched from a reliable API (e.g., Open Exchange Rates API).
Support for conversion between major world currencies.
Option to update currency exchange rates manually or automatically at regular intervals.
Error handling for invalid inputs and network connectivity issues.
Customizable GUI elements to enhance user experience.
This project will be a great opportunity to apply Python programming skills, learn about GUI development with Tkinter, and interact with web APIs for fetching currency exchange rates. Contributions and feedback are welcome for further improvement and enhancement of the application.
